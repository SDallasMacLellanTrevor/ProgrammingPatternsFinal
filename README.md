For my project I will be making a Bank Management System which will act as a simple application with which both bank Tellers and Bank customers will be able to perform various activities
such as making new accounts, depositing and withdrawing funds, and purchasing assets. Accounts will be managed by Tellers who can also view all users, and information about specific bank accounts.

Since Tellers and Customers should have different levels of permissions, different options will be made available depending on who's using the application, for instance:

Tellers:
Tellers will be able to deposit and withdraw funds for users
View all customers and all their accounts
view specific customers and their account histories
transfer funds between accounts for customers
make accounts for customers as requested

Customers:
Customers will be able to see their own account transaction histories
Deposit and withdraw funds
Take out loans for themselves
Apply for credit cards
Purchase and invest in assets
